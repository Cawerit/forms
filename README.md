## Contributing
### Prerequisites
- Clone the repository to your local folder
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (preferably the latest stable version). *Note:* package manager npm should be included in the installation.
- **Recommended:** Some libraries might require that the git installation is on the *path*. You can test this by running `git --help` on the command window (not in separate git shell). See [SO](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26620861) for troubleshooting.
- **Optional:** Install plugin "livereload" on your browser, like [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fi/firefox/addon/livereload/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

You can test that Node and npm are working correctly by running commands `node -v` (should output something like "v5.4.1") and `npm -v` (should output something like "3.3.12").

### Build (todo)
- On shell/command window, navigate to the folder that contains this file and run `npm run build`

### Start (todo)
- On shell/command window, navigate to the folder that contains this file and run `npm run start` or if you also want the project to reload when files are changed, run `npm run watch` (note: requires the livereload plugin mentioned earlier)
